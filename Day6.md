#### :globe_with_meridians: Styling the wonderful World Wide Web.
When I studied electronics engineering back in high school, we spend so much time learning about old technologies just in case we had to work on old systems like the >115 years old Parisians métro.
This is exactly what we are doing here, CSS evolve a lot in the last years and if you only know how to do a grid system with the latest functionality you won't be able to work on code that's only  year old. So let's learn the web of 2005 so we can build the web of 2017.

####:dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, today felt a lot more like scripting with CSS, but we always spend morning time to do some JS exercise, just to warm-up the brain.
**Talking about it**, I recorded another quick chat with myself, if you realy have nothing better to do then check it out, [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-6-58).

####:book: TIL :

- **HTML**
        - [Landmark](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles) tags like `<main>`, `<navigation>`, `<search>`,… should only appear **once** in the page. There role is to help users navigate to the region they describe.
        - Do not use "legacy" tags like `<b> </b>`, instead use more semantic ones like `<em>`, another example : <br> should not be used anymore, use the CSS margin/padding property instead.
- **CSS**
        - **selectors**  Use a greater-than sign ( E > A) to select any E element that is a child  of an A element. EX:  "article > p" will only select  <p\> tags that are a direct child of <article\>, leaving the nested one unchanged.
        - **box-sizing: border-box;** use it to get your calculation right.
        - User agent style sheet, will try to screw you.
        - By default, CSS will try to screw you.
